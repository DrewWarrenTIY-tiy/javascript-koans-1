Homework Log:

Thinking About Expects:
koans 1-3: So far so good!
Finished off strong.

Thinking About Arrays:
koan 6: When you have a () after an array number ...denotes? that at the index is a function... you expect the array value to be the product of the function.
object["key"]: same as object.key.

koan 7-8: Nothing to note
koan 9: If you pass in the same index for both params of the array.slice() method, you'll get an empty array. Also, if you pass a higher index in the first param and a lower index in the second, you'll get an empty array. The second param/index in the array.slice method is NOT kept in the slice.
