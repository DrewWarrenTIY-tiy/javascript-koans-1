Homework Log:

Thinking About Expects:
koans 1-3: So far so good!
Finished off strong.

Thinking About Arrays:
koan 6: When you have a () after an array number ...denotes? that at the index is a function... you expect the array value to be the product of the function.
object["key"]: same as object.key.

koan 7-8: Nothing to note

koan 9: If you pass in the same index for both params of the array.slice() method, you'll get an empty array. Also, if you pass a higher index in the first param and a lower index in the second, you'll get an empty array. The second param/index in the array.slice method is NOT kept in the slice.

koan 10: Nothing to note.

koan 11: Had to research Array.pop - it returns the last value in an Array after removing it from the Array.

koan 12: Also had to look up Array.shift - the same as pop but the first instead of the last. Array.unshift adds a value to the first element of the array.

Thinking About Functions:

koan 13-15: Nothing to note.

koan 16: This one is hard to wrap my head around. Not sure how to look up an explanation for this syntax either. **Would love an explanation of this one!** I was able to finish the test and I see how the numbers add up, but an explanation of how the function actually works would be great.

koan 17: Nothing to note.

koan 18: I understand what is happening with praiseSinger and appendRules. The syntax of defining a variable with { function: method } is new and I would like a little more explanation. givePraise is not asking for any parameters, but it's using the parameter its given as the parameter for its method. Interesting..
