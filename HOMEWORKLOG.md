Homework Log:

Thinking About Expects:
koans 1-3: So far so good!
Finished off strong.

Thinking About Arrays:
koan 6: When you have a () after an array number ...denotes? that at the index is a function... you expect the array value to be the product of the function.
object["key"]: same as object.key.

koan 7-8: Nothing to note

koan 9: If you pass in the same index for both params of the array.slice() method, you'll get an empty array. Also, if you pass a higher index in the first param and a lower index in the second, you'll get an empty array. The second param/index in the array.slice method is NOT kept in the slice.

koan 10: Nothing to note.

koan 11: Had to research Array.pop - it returns the last value in an Array after removing it from the Array.

koan 12: Also had to look up Array.shift - the same as pop but the first instead of the last. Array.unshift adds a value to the first element of the array.

Thinking About Functions:

koan 13-15: Nothing to note.

koan 16: This one is hard to wrap my head around. Not sure how to look up an explanation for this syntax either. **Would love an explanation of this one!** I was able to finish the test and I see how the numbers add up, but an explanation of how the function actually works would be great.

koan 17: Nothing to note.

koan 18: I understand what is happening with praiseSinger and appendRules. The syntax of defining a variable with { function: method } is new and I would like a little more explanation. givePraise is not asking for any parameters, but it's using the parameter its given as the parameter for its method. Interesting..

Thinking About Mutability:

koan 19: Pretty straightforward.

koan 20: **Starting to get confused between the something.something syntax. Sometimes it's a method... but I think the same syntax is used to refer to Object Properties... so .firstname is not a method of the Person Constructor but is referencing the object property of aPerson? I think?**

koan 21: Made sense to me!

koan 22: Learned that you can't change the properties of a Constructor once they are defined. If you change the properties and then remake the constructor they will be changed.

Thinking About Higher Order Functions:

koan 23: Made sense but still not sure what exactly underscore is. Will look into it when I inevitable get more confused!

koan 24: Easy enough

koan 25: "reduce boils down a list of values into a single value" from UnderscoreJS page. i.e. 3+2+1 = 6

koan 26: forEach "Iterates over a list of elements, yielding each in turn to an iteratee function. The iteratee is bound to the context object, if one is passed."

koan 27: all "Returns true if all of the values in the list pass the predicate truth test. Short-circuits and stops traversing the list if a false element is found."

koan 28: any "Returns true if any of the values in the list pass the predicate truth test. Short-circuits and stops traversing the list if a true element is found."

koan 29: range "A function to create flexibly-numbered lists of integers, handy for each and map loops. start, if omitted, defaults to 0; step defaults to 1. Returns a list of integers from start (inclusive) to stop (exclusive), incremented (or decremented) by step, exclusive. Note that ranges that stop before they start are considered to be zero-length instead of negative â€” if you'd like a negative range, use a negative step."
I'm not sure why the array ends 1 before the number named for the end. **Also not sure why there is a space before the first value.**

koan 30: flatten "Flattens a nested array (the nesting can be to any depth). If you pass shallow, the array will only be flattened a single level." **These ones don't have a space before the first value... what gives?**

koan 31: "Calling chain will cause all future method calls to return wrapped objects. When you've finished the computation, call value to retrieve the final value."
First the array is flattened to be easy to deal with, then map adds 1 to each value, then reduce adds them all together.

Thinking about Objects:

koan 32-33: Easy Enough

koan 34: **Properties that are functions act like methods** This again confuses me.. I guess that you reference object functions and object non-functions the same way... I got the answer on the first try but the syntax is confusing because I feel like I've seen an object property that is a function referenced without parameters... Maybe I'm just confused.

koan 35: "When a function is attached to an object, 'this' refers to the object." What a great way to describe that concept. I was trying to explain that but couldn't find the words. Great stuff!

koan 36-37: **OMFG Venture Bros reference! Love it!!!** "The in operator returns true if the specified property is in the specified object"

koan 38: Easy peasy

koan 39: **Is prototype just for functions (like methods)? or for all object property possibilities?**

Thinking About Inheritance:

koan 40-43: Makes sense. Reading Crockford's article on Prototypal Inheritance was very interesting. I don't grasp it well enough to implement it, but am starting to understand objects creating instances of themselves. **Would like an example, though.**

koan 44-47: First try. Not sure the difference between this.gonzo.doTrick() and this.gonzo.trick .. I guess one is a function that returns the value and the other is just the value itself.

koan 48: First try.

koan 49: **Was expecting to use something along the lines of:**

var result = _(products).chain()
                        .filter(.containsNuts() )
                        .all(!hasMushrooms)
                        .value();_ (last underscore included for font formatting, not in my attempt)
However, the test is looking for a 0... and my attempt at solving with these higher order functions just broke the test and lowered the total koan count and bumped me out of 'applyingwhatwelearned' so I couldn't really see where I was going wrong. I just input the 0 it was looking for and moved forward. For the record it should have been looking for a 1, right?

koan 50: I plugged in 'sum' because the function to find it looked sound... I could have pulled it out and run it in console to get the number and plugged that in. I don't know if I missed the point of this one.

koan 51: **I couldn't figure out  how to make the range function do both 3's and 5's. I could only get one or the other. How to do both?**

koan 52-53:
Could not figure out syntactically how to write the higher order functions to decipher through the products object.
